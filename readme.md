# HDI_Typed_Object_Field

With 4D 20 R10, object typing takes a major step forward, giving you more confidence and control in your code. Instead of simply checking if a value is an object, 4D now verifies that itâ€™s an instance of a specific class. This unlocks smarter auto-completion, inline validation, and stricter compilation checks, helping you catch mistakes early and write clearer, more maintainable code.
